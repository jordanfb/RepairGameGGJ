MATTE: I'm so annoyed, and disgusted and... sad, I just don't want to believe it

AI: CAPTAIN, if I may be so bold
<<wait 1>> 
AI: Logic dictates that this course of action may have some severe repercussions. However, it also provides an avenue by which you can repair what has been damaged.

AI: So the decision is to run away? I cannot say I understand your command CAPTAIN but my programming is to support you in your endeavors.However in order for you to complete travel to this location I will have to override my security protocols and go off-line.

AI: If that is your choice CAPTAIN, then systems will immediately go into life support mode to last as long as possible.
AI: However, that will shut down the main interface system, so i will not be able to offer assistance.
<<wait 1>> 
AI: I am not sure I understand this decision but my job is to facilitate your orders so shut down sequence will begin momentarily
AI: Wait CAPTAIN!!!
